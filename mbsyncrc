# THEN WE SPECIFY THE LOCAL AND REMOTE STORAGE
# - THE REMOTE STORAGE IS WHERE WE GET THE MAIL FROM (E.G., THE
#   SPECIFICATION OF AN IMAP ACCOUNT)
# - THE LOCAL STORAGE IS WHERE WE STORE THE EMAIL ON OUR COMPUTER

# CONNECTIONS SPECIFY LINKS BETWEEN REMOTE AND LOCAL FOLDERS
#
# CONNECTIONS ARE SPECIFIED USING PATTERNS, WHICH MATCH REMOTE MAIl
# FOLDERS. SOME COMMONLY USED PATTERS INCLUDE:
#
# 1 "*" TO MATCH EVERYTHING
# 2 "!DIR" TO EXCLUDE "DIR"
# 3 "DIR" TO MATCH DIR
#
# FOR INSTANCE IN THE SPECIFICATION BELOW:
#
# gmail-inbox gets the folder INBOX, ARCHIVE, and everything under "ARCHIVE*"
# gmail-trash gets only the "[Gmail]/Trash" folder and stores it to the local "trash" folder


#====================================================================================================================================

# The "Channel" is used when invoking mbsync to tell it which Channel to "watch"
# Far tells it which IMAPStore to look at, (in this case look for the one called "just.a.label"
# Near is where to put it, (this _can_ be a remote IMAP server! Cool for migrations)
# the last three are more example settings. Check the man for more.

# A Channel can pull from multiple accounts or server at the same time!

#================================================================================

# What we set SSLVersions to depends on the output of

# openssl s_client -connect imap.gmail.com:993 -showcerts | grep Protocol

# C-c out of that command once it says * OK Gimap ready for requests from <your IP address>. You must have also noticed that we store passwords in encrypted files. Very easy to do: write the password for account acc1-gmail in a plain-text file .mbsyncpass-acc1 and on the terminal do

# gpg2 -c .mbsyncpass-acc1

# You will be asked for a password, enter it, memorize it, and delete the plain-text file containing your password. You can also do this in Emacs when visiting the file, using M-x epa-encrypt-file and simply selecting the option [OK]. Emacs will also automatically decrypt any encrypted files when opening them, you might of course be asked for your password.
